              <h2>How does it work?</h2>
              <p>
                Chordly is made for practicing chords. Are you getting bored
                with the same, well known patterns? I think you should give it a
                try. Accept challenge to open up for the unexpected stream of
                random chords!
              </p>
              <h3>Personalize</h3>
              <p>
                You can start practicing chords right away with default
                settings, but wouldn't it be nicer to play with your own rules?
                Choose visibility of features, set a perfect tempo and repeat
                chords as much as you like. Chordly will remember your settings
                on the same device &#8211; if you come back &#8211; it's still
                here.
              </p>
              <h3>Choose chords</h3>
              <p>
                Wanna try something harder or perfect your skills? Just check
                chords you like.
              </p>
              <h3>Get it started</h3>
              <p>
                Are you ready? No worries, you can adjust your settings on the
                fly. Just click start button, prepare instrument, watch the
                countdown end and play! Have enough? Just click the pause
                button.
              </p>
              <h2>More details?</h2>
              <p>
                Chordly allows you to choose the time signature for metronome.
                You can turn it off if you'd like to practice all alone. You can
                use Chordly on any device that has internet connection. You can
                simply put your phone on your piano or on your music stand. Too
                small to focus? A fullscreen mode is just for you.
