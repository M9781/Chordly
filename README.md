Chordly was created to support musicians &#8211; begginers, advanced and those in the midway &#128513; BUT especially for my wife, the originator and supporter &#128525;

Chordly is an app that was created to hone your skills. Chordly will force you to expect the unexpected and help you react spontaneously to every chord changes. You will be able to play smoother and more confident.
